# DardosLife
DardosLife is a personal project for recreational and learning purposes in which I have transformed a basic commercial electronic dartboard into one that, 
through an Arduino, is capable of sending information about where a dart has impacted to the computer. Using GODOT on the computer, I have programmed five different games: 
501 series, cricket, battleship, connect4, and football. 

Its use for commercial purposes is not permitted. 
The game concepts of battleship and connect4 are original creations, and the creator does not allow their commercial exploitation without consent. 

Project developer: Andr√©s Tejero Mena (tejeromenaandres@gmail.com).
